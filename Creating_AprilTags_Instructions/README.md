Instructions on Creating AprilTags:

1) Determine the desired size of your AprilTags (this folder includes pages of 2 inch tags).
2) Go to https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag/ to download PNGs of the Apriltags (36h11 is the recommended type).
3) Using GIMP, a free image manipulation program, create a new file. Determine the pixels per inch you need to get the appropriate sized Apriltags (for example, each 36h11 tag is an 8 pixel square, so getting 2 inch tags requires 4 pixels per inch). Specify that amount for pixels per inch, and make the page size 8.5 in by 11 in.
4) Open the Apriltag PNGs in GIMP. For each PNG, copy it onto the 8.5 x 11 page. Ideally, paste them in a specific order based on the Apriltag ID, so you know which tag corresponds to which ID.
5) Once you have filled the page up, we need to increase the size of the page, since printers by default print at 72 pixels per inch. Therefore, go to Image > Scale Image. Specify the pixels per inch as 72, and then specify the image size as 8.5 in by 11 in. IMPORTANTLY, select None for the Interpolation option -- this is crucial so the tags do not get blurry and un-detectable.
6) Once the image is scaled, save it, export it as a jpg, and print it out. Importantly, since you want the tags to be exactly the size you determined, make sure you print the jpg image at 100% scale (some printing programs automatically scale it down to add a margin, which reduces the size of the Apriltags).
7) Enjoy, and goot luck! :)

NOTE: In the pages of 2 inch tags in this folder, they go in increasing order row-wise. i.e. the first row of Pg1 has tag IDs 0, 1, 2, and the first column of the same page has tag IDs 0, 3, 6, 9. After printing the Apriltags out, it is highly recommended that you write the ID on the back of each tag, in consistent corner of the tag, so you know both the ID and orientation of each printed out tag.
